case design was created in OpenSCAD:

which can be used to modify the design as well as generate STL files to be used for 3D printing.

The image below is a rendering of the bottom box part of the case.  It has mounts for two 40 mm fans on the back.  The left side has a cut out for feeding wires through.  The right side has slots to access the micro USB and SD card connectors on the circuit board. The bottom has cylindrical stand offs for the circuit board with holes to accomodate M3 screws 6 mm in length.  Self-tapping screws are not necessary.  The "mouse ears" on the box corner are to aid in keeping the box corners from lifting during printing. The mouse ears can be cut off after printing.
