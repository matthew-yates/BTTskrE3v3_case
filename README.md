case design was created in OpenSCAD:

which can be used to modify the design as well as generate STL files to be used for 3D printing.

The image below is a rendering of the bottom box part of the case.  It has mounts for two 40 mm fans on the back.  The left side has a cut out for feeding wires through.  The right side has slots to access the micro USB and SD card connectors on the circuit board. The bottom has cylindrical stand offs for the circuit board with holes to accomodate M3 screws 6 mm in length.  Self-tapping screws are not necessary.  The "mouse ears" on the box corner are to aid in keeping the box corners from lifting during printing. The mouse ears can be cut off after printing.

The image below is a rendering of the top box portion of the case.  It has four cylindrical standoffs with holes that are used to mount the TFT35 E3 V3 circuit board using M3 screws 8 mm in length.  Self tapping screws are not required.  The box has a square cutout for the LCD screen.  Below the LCD screen cutout is a circular cutout for the mounting the control knob. There is a flexible tab below the LCD screen cutout that is used for pressing the reset button. Two rectangluar cutouts are on the left and right sides.  One of these cutouts allows access to the USB A port and SD card reader.  The other rectangular cutout is for ventilation only.  There are circular "mouse ears" and thin rectangular supports on each of the four corners that aid in 3D printing.  The mouse ears and supports can be cut off the part after printing.

The image below is a rendering of an exploded view of the completed case after removing printer supports, mounting the TFT35 E3 V3 board to the top portion of the case, and mounting the SKR Mini E3 V3 board to the bottome portion of the case.  The case is colored blue and the Bigtreetech components are colored gray.
